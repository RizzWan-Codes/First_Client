      <h2>Burger Trends That Will Rule 2025</h2>
      <p>The burger world is evolving faster than ever, and 2025 is the year of innovation, sustainability, and flavor explosions. From plant-based marvels to AI-powered menus, here’s what you can expect when you walk into a burger joint this year.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 2 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. Plant-Powered Revolution</h2>
      <p>Plant-based burgers are no longer the side act—they’re headlining the show. With advanced protein tech, meatless patties now mimic real meat so well that even hardcore carnivores are switching sides. Expect ingredients like pea protein, jackfruit, and lentil blends to dominate menus everywhere.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 3 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. AI-Designed Burgers</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is not just for tech geeks—it’s now cooking your burger! AI algorithms analyze customer preferences and create unique flavor profiles that hit the sweet spot for your taste buds. Imagine a burger made exactly for you, every single time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 4 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Fusion Flavors That Break Borders</h2>
      <p>The global food scene is blending into your burger. Korean Gochujang sauces, Indian masala patties, and Mexican chipotle mayo are making their way into buns. Expect a world tour in every bite, without leaving your city.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 5 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>4. Health-Conscious Indulgence</h2>
      <p>2025 burgers are going guilt-free without losing the fun. Think low-carb buns, keto-friendly toppings, and sauces packed with probiotics. Air-fried patties, avocado spreads, and sugar-free dressings are set to become the norm for the health-conscious generation.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 6 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Sustainable Packaging and Practices</h2>
      <p>Eco-friendly is the new cool. From biodegradable wrappers to zero-waste kitchens, burger joints are stepping up their sustainability game. Customers now care as much about the planet as they do about their meal—and brands that ignore this are falling behind.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Card 7 -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. Extreme Customization</h2>
      <p>Forget “one size fits all.” In 2025, every burger is your burger. QR codes on tables let you build your dream burger from bun to sauce to toppings—all with real-time nutritional info and allergen alerts. The era of ultimate personalization is here.</p>
