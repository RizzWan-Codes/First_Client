      <h2>How It All Began</h2>
      <p>Globurg started with one mission — to break the monotony of boring burgers. We wanted bold, fiery, and unforgettable bites. Our journey began in a small kitchen in Aurangabad, where passion met creativity. Every recipe was tested dozens of times before making it to the menu. We focused on sourcing fresh vegetables, soft artisan buns, and the best Indian spices to create burgers with a desi twist. Over time, our tiny idea turned into a local sensation, thanks to the love of foodies who craved something different. Today, Globurg is known for serving the ultimate comfort food without compromising on quality or taste. Every burger is cooked to perfection and served with care because you deserve nothing but the best!</p>

      <h2>The Menu That Started a Craze</h2>
      <p>From juicy chicken delights to paneer tikka sensations, our menu is a playground for burger lovers. Our signature Crispy Chicken Burger is layered with creamy sauces and fresh lettuce for that perfect crunch. For our vegetarian fans, the Paneer Makhani Burger and Aloo Masala Burger are absolute showstoppers, packed with authentic Indian flavors. And it doesn’t stop there — our loaded fries, masala peri-peri fries, and cheesy nachos turn every meal into a feast. To top it off, we’ve got thick shakes in flavors like chocolate, mango, and cold coffee, giving you the ultimate combo experience. Every month, we launch a limited-edition burger that keeps our fans excited and always coming back for more. At Globurg, food is never just food — it’s an experience that satisfies your soul.</p>
